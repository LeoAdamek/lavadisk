 Lavadisk
==========

Keeping your backups **HOT!**


About Lavadisk
--------------

Lavadisk is a simple tool for keeping your AWS disks backed up with recent snapshots.
It handles scheduling backups, purging old ones and notification on failure / success.


About the Rewrite
-----------------

The current version of Lavadisk is written in Python. However I've decided that for ease of deployment,
footprint and robust design to re-write the application in Go.


Stay tuned for when this version becomes stable!
