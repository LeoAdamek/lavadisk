Quick Start
-----------

Here's a quick run-down of how to get your systems backed up for point-in-time restore with Lavadisk.

1. Download Lavadisk
2. Install dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt` (this installs boto)
3. Create a configuration file.
4. Run it with `./lavadisk --config-file PATH_TO_CONFIG`
5. Schedule backups by creating a cron-job, set it to run at least as often as your most regular backup.
