What services is Lavadisk compatible with?
    Currently, lavadisk is only compatible with Amazon Web Services.
    I have no plans to add support for other services but will accept pull requests.

How can I run Lavadisk across multiple regions?
    Just run the same Lavadisk job for each region, but send in the ``--region`` option
    to change which region the task will run in.

My Question Wasn't Answered!
    If that's the case, just drop a github issue on the repository and I'll pick it up.
