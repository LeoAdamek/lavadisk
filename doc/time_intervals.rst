Time Intervals
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Several options in Lavadisk are configured as time intervals.
The syntax for which is::

  Xw Yd Zh

Where X, Y and Z are integers, and w, d, h are weeks, days and hours respectively.
All three w , d , h are required, but can be set to 0, see the example in :doc:`Configuration </configuration>`
